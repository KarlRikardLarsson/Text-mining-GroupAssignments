        "    \"One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked. They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.\",\n",
        "    \"A wonderful little production. The filming technique is very unassuming- very old-time-BBC fashion and gives a comforting, and sometimes discomforting, sense of realism to the entire piece. The actors are extremely well chosen- Michael Sheen not only 'has got all the polari' but he has all the voices down pat too! You can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to Williams' diary entries, not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece. A masterful production about one of the great master's of comedy and his life. The realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which, rather than use the traditional 'dream' techniques remains solid then disappears. It plays on our knowledge and our senses, particularly with the scenes concerning Orton and Halliwell and the sets (particularly of their flat with Halliwell's murals decorating every surface) are terribly well done.\",\n",
        "    \"I thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend, sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light-hearted comedy. The plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable (even the well bread suspected serial killer). While some may be disappointed when they realize this is not Match Point 2: Risk Addiction, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love.This was the most I'd laughed at one of Woody's comedies in years (dare I say a decade?). While I've never been impressed with Scarlet Johanson, in this she managed to tone down her 'sexy' image and jumped right into a average, but spirited young woman.This may not be the crown jewel of his career, but it was wittier than 'Devil Wears Prada' and more interesting than 'Superman' a great comedy to go see with friends.\",\n",
        "    \"Basically there's a family where a little boy (Jake) thinks there's a zombie in his closet & his parents are fighting all the time.This movie is slower than a soap opera... and suddenly, Jake decides to become Rambo and kill the zombie.OK, first of all when you're going to make a film you must Decide if its a thriller or a drama! As a drama the movie is watchable. Parents are divorcing & arguing like in real life. And then we have Jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film! I expected to see a BOOGEYMAN similar movie, and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots.3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents & descent dialogs. As for the shots with Jake: just ignore them.\",\n",
        "    \"Petter Mattei's 'Love in the Time of Money' is a visually stunning film to watch. Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations. This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzler's play about the same theme, the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect. Each one is connected in one way, or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment, as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter.The acting is good under Mr. Mattei's direction. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and the rest of the talented cast, make these characters come alive.We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work.\",\n",
        "    \"Probably my all-time favorite movie, a story of selflessness, sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause, but it's not preachy or boring. It just never gets old, despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years. Paul Lukas' performance brings tears to my eyes, and Bette Davis, in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles, is a delight. The kids are, as grandma says, more like 'dressed-up midgets' than children, but that only makes them more fun to watch. And the mother's slow awakening to what's happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling. If I had a dozen thumbs, they'd all be 'up' for this movie.\",\n",
        "    \"I sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated Seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in me.I grew up on black and white TV and Seahunt with Gunsmoke were my hero's every week.You have my vote for a comeback of a new sea hunt.We need a change of pace in TV and this would work for a world of under water adventure.Oh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about TV and the many movies.So any ole way I believe I've got what I wanna say.Would be nice to read some more plus points about sea hunt.If my rhymes would be 10 lines would you let me submit,or leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quit,If this is so then I must go so lets do it.\",\n",
        "    \"This show was an amazing, fresh & innovative idea in the 70's when it first aired. The first 7 or 8 years were brilliant, but things dropped off after that. By 1990, the show was not really funny anymore, and it's continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today.It's truly disgraceful how far this show has fallen. The writing is painfully bad, the performances are almost as bad - if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guest-hosts, this show probably wouldn't still be on the air. I find it so hard to believe that the same creator that hand-selected the original cast also chose the band of hacks that followed. How can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity? I felt I must give 2 stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such a huge success. As it is now, the show is just awful. I can't believe it's still on the air.\",\n",
        "    \"Encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here I was looking forward to watching this film. Bad mistake. I've seen 950+ films and this is truly one of the worst of them - it's awful in almost every way: editing, pacing, storyline, 'acting,' soundtrack (the film's only song - a lame country tune - is played no less than four times). The film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme. Rarely have I been so happy to see the end credits of a film. The only thing that prevents me giving this a 1-score is Harvey Keitel - while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort. One for Keitel obsessives only.\",\n",

It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.

The plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable (even the well bread suspected serial killer). While some may be disappointed when they realize this is not Match Point 2: Risk Addiction, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love.This was the most I'd laughed at one of Woody's comedies in years (dare I say a decade?). While I've never been impressed with Scarlet Johanson, in this she managed to tone down her 'sexy' image and jumped right into a average, but spirited young woman.This may not be the crown jewel of his career, but it was wittier than 'Devil Wears Prada' and more interesting than 'Superman' a great comedy to go see with friends.

It's hard not to feel that he never got anything to work by himself for one night or a half. When you're getting good at something, you can never go back into it. The only issue is that this is a good little story. It doesn't show what he truly came to love about love and his own heart (something I've already given this one 4.6 stars out of 5). This is the kind of story you get when you're in love with someone who has only touched you on a little bit of their own history. As the story progresses, you feel to see everything around you change and it doesn't take a genius to get everyone to love you a little better. If you get more into romance with someone who has only been with you three times and never seen the romance that they are in, then this is pretty much what you should be getting out of Match Point 3.For any of you who have been thinking about Match Point 2: Risk Addiction in the same way that I have: you're at a loss...it's so damn hard (sorry). I can say I enjoyed it first one, but it was something you wouldn't expect from such a mature comedies. I hope in match point 3 you'll have a good laugh about something this good.

That is what is going on here. This is the first time a show about fascism starts in such a violent manner. This show is a continuation from the film The Grand Budapest Hotel: It starts out very funny, but is actually incredibly violent and hilarious. The Red Shirts are called, the film does not even start. Their main villain is played by a character from the film of the same name (and a lot of my favorite people are not in this title, except for the actors). The Red Shirts are not real fascists or the Red Terrorists but are just plain racists and are looking to intimidate and kill white people. He is actually an evil genius figure and one of the strongest and smartest men the Red Shirts have ever had.\n",

I would like to leave you with a quote regarding the show to remind you that, as far as I'm concerned, there's a pretty big and important question here: does this show need an audience or a paywall?In response, here is what you are asking, Mr. Witten:Now from this very short conversation, the above question was answered.The answer is, a viewer has to pay extra for an audience if they want to see this show. Of course, not everybody is willing to accept that. The more and more the show has fallen off precipitously, the more I've started to believe that this show is in fact not worthy of paying for an audience. I think it helps to have an agenda to talk about this show more and more, but for many other shows, such as shows that have lost popularity due to the \"dignity\" of the show, this is not an issue of that.If you are interested in the topic in this blog or if you have ideas or experiences that they have that I think is pertinent at this point, then you can leave a review and comment here that they can do a better job of talking about other shows I think have been a bit tarnished with their past.

They've changed quite a bit and had my favorite part from the last one: my aunt that you would never see. I was 6 years old. It was scary what would happen when I left in the sixth grade, I'm 21 now and I'm at my dad's house trying to get a haircut. She was so upset and hurt, she was crying. I just sat there like, \"What do I do? Do what I do? It's okay, you look good, you're doing great.\" I am so grateful. I was just so upset, my parents were in tears, I took the book off my shelf, but they're not crying right now. My mom told me to go find my mom and my uncle who live by yourself in the street, but the next day my little sister went missing, she went to my uncle and I picked up my mom's house and ran up and down the road to find her. I couldn't believe I'd been to my uncle, they said my mom was out there doing her chores, but they wouldn't let me'}]                                                                                                                                                                               "

They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.</td>\n",

It's hard not to feel that he never got anything to work by himself for one night or a half. When you're getting good at something, you can never go back into it. The only issue is that this is a good little story. It doesn't show what he truly came to love about love and his own heart (something I've already given this one 4.6 stars out of 5). This is the kind of story you get when you're in love with someone who has only touched you on a little bit of their own history. As the story progresses, you feel to see everything around you change and it doesn't take a genius to get everyone to love you a little better. If you get more into romance with someone who has only been with you three times and never seen the romance that they are in, then this is pretty much what you should be getting out of Match Point 3.For any of you who have been thinking about Match Point 2: Risk Addiction in the same way that I have: you're at a loss...it's so damn hard (sorry). I can say I enjoyed it first one, but it was something you wouldn't expect from such a mature comedies. I hope in match point 3 you'll have a good laugh about something this good.

As a drama the movie is watchable. Parents are divorcing &amp; arguing like in real life. And then we have Jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film! I expected to see a BOOGEYMAN similar movie, and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots.3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents &amp; descent dialogs. As for the shots with Jake: just ignore them. If the screen was made of aluminum &amp; there was no movie you would be impressed how well cast and crew is. Also, there were just some poor ass shots which were probably some kind of \"scary\" movie. But the characters and the acting was amazing. The dialogue was a bit off and not good at the best of times. But still, this was good. I would recommend this film if you are into any kind of suspense films. I think this movie is worth a try. And i will definitely be making more. 4 out of 5 Stars!\n",

That is what is going on here. This is the first time a show about fascism starts in such a violent manner. This show is a continuation from the film The Grand Budapest Hotel: It starts out very funny, but is actually incredibly violent and hilarious.

Their main villain is played by a character from the film of the same name (and a lot of my favorite people are not in this title, except for the actors).

I would like to leave you with a quote regarding the show to remind you that, as far as I'm concerned, there's a pretty big and important question here: does this show need an audience or a paywall?In response, here is what you are asking, Mr. Witten:Now from this very short conversation, the above question was answered.The answer is, a viewer has to pay extra for an audience if they want to see this show. Of course, not everybody is willing to accept that. The more and more the show has fallen off precipitously, the more I've started to believe that this show is in fact not worthy of paying for an audience. I think it helps to have an agenda to talk about this show more and more, but for many other shows, such as shows that have lost popularity due to the \"dignity\" of the show, this is not an issue of that.If you are interested in the topic in this blog or if you have ideas or experiences that they have that I think is pertinent at this point, then you can leave a review and comment here that they can do a better job of talking about other shows I think have been a bit tarnished with their past.

        "Above are the results, with the original text on the left for reference, its interesting to see how GPT-2 tries in some cases to continue on the review but sometimes you can see how prohibitive the training data is as it's trying to predict the next token. For example the review at index 3, GPT2 does an attempt to continue the original review, but eventually it just ended the current review and started giving reviews for other films. Other times its just straight up comical, where GPT2 just gets totally derailed from the topic, my favourite is the last review where GPT2 goes on a very amazing journey through life and shares some stories with us, very well worth a read. My personal favorite lines are \"My mom told me to go find my mom\" and \"she went to my uncle and I picked up my mom's house and ran up and down the road to find her\""

        "A big problem with text generation in general that has surfaced a lot with the release of ChatGPT is that text generation can often be confidently wrong. Meaning it will generate text that sounds and looks very well written and factual, but can be inherently wrong. Also what the language model will generate heavily depends on what data it was trained on. In the case of ChatGPT it very often generates unnecesarily long and wordy statements to simple questions, which goes back to the type of training data it has had access to where probably longer sentences mean better performance. This can be dangerous if people would use it as a unmoderated source for generating for example news articles or similar things as in the case of ChatGPT it can in many cases perform very well, but in some cases its just completely wrong but will still answer with 100% confidence which can make it hard to discern whats correct and not from its answers.\n",

        "[Robert Miles makes an interesting note](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w65p_IIp6JY) on this regard saying that AI/language models aren't actually trying to \"tell the truth\" and is instead just trying to say what we want it to say based on the training data. For example, what happens if we break a mirror? the language model may respond with \"7 years of bad luck\" - its not really the case that the language model believes that, but that the biases and text present in the training data would point to that. And in some cases, the language model may even \"lie\" as to say the things that it thinks we want it to say (for example in the case if we incorporate reinforcment learning and give negative and positive rewards to the agent). \n",
        "\n",
        "There's also the inherent biases that can be created from the training data. All a language model does is trying to predict what the next token is based on the training it went through with the available training data. So lets say we train a language model based on a huge dataset on disasters or propaganda in the news, it may have some very different answers and views on things than a model trained on for example wikipedia. Therefore it's important to recognize what biases are inherent in the training data, because the model will reflect the biases that exists in the training data we give it.\n",
        "\n",
        "A common theme for above is that it all concerns the data in some way, so a critical part of building a strong and representative language model is to have strong and representative data that the model can learn from. This is of course way easier said than done and is one of the hardest parts of launching a successful model."
